# Hide small planets

This plugin overwrites the zoom based detail level of the map so that smaller planets can be hidden even on higher zoom levels. Planets with an owner are preferred. Everything goes back to normal when the plugin window is closed. Please note that small planets always flash for a second while zooming - didn't find a workaround for it yet.

Hiding planets can also improve rendering performance especially with slower GPUs by reducing the number of draw calls.

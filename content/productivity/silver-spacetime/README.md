# Silver Spacetime

This plugin has a bunch of overlap with Distribute Silver but I wanted to add automatic sending, the problem was that it caused a bunch of network congestion in 0.6 Round 1.

In order to deal with that, I added a bunch of controls to adjust how much you wanted to congest and it grew too large for that plugin.

This also contains an automatic withdraw feature.

Be aware: This has opinions about how you should distribute your silver and will even try to capture unowned spacetime rips nearby.

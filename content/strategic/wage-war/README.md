# Wage War

This plugin is used to grab statistics about a user-specified empire. Once information is grabbed, the plugin ranks the target empire's planets by their ability to attack you and by their ability to reinforce themselves. If you so choose, you can wage an automated war on them, using your planets to attack their with timed attacks in order of highest-value.
